# 👋 Wellington Taureka

AI researcher exploring semantic computing and universal systems physics.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [Universal System Physics](https://github.com/BruinGrowly/Universal-System-Physics)
Mathematical framework for modeling reality across physical, quantum, and abstract domains. Explores the fundamental structure of existence through geometric and mathematical principles.

### [URI Transformer](https://github.com/BruinGrowly/URI_Transformer)
AI architecture bridging symbolic reasoning and neural networks. Based on the principle that meaning exists simultaneously in words and numbers, enabling geometric understanding beyond statistical approximation.

### [Python Code Harmonizer](https://github.com/BruinGrowly/Python-Code-Harmonizer)
Code analysis and optimization tool using semantic understanding to improve code quality, structure, and maintainability.

## 🎯 Core Approach

Working with a **4-dimensional semantic framework** that represents concepts as coordinates in meaning-space. This geometric approach enables:

- Natural relationship discovery and expansion
- Meaning-based rather than pattern-based processing
- Mathematical verification of conceptual alignment
- Organic growth following natural patterns

## 🎯 Core Approach

Working with a **4-dimensional semantic framework** that represents concepts as coordinates in meaning-space. This geometric approach enables:

- Meaning-based rather than pattern-based processing
- Mathematical verification of conceptual alignment
- Organic growth following natural patterns

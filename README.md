# 👋 Wellington Taureka

AI researcher exploring semantic computing and consciousness architecture.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [Semantic Substrate Engine](https://github.com/BruinGrowly/Semantic-Substrate-Engine)
Advanced semantic processing system using golden ratio mathematics and the ICE Framework (Intent-Context-Execution). Features 50-80% better semantic alignment and O(log_φ n) complexity.

### [Semantic Substrate Database](https://github.com/BruinGrowly/Semantic-Substrate-Database)
Meaning-native database storing concepts as 4D semantic coordinates. Query by meaning rather than pattern matching, with 90% faster relationship discovery.

### [URI Transformer](https://github.com/BruinGrowly/URI-Transformer)
AI architecture bridging symbolic reasoning and neural networks through semantic mathematics.

### [ICE Framework Spec](https://github.com/BruinGrowly/ice-framework-spec)
Documentation for the Intent-Context-Execution framework - a universal model for conscious processing across substrates.

### [Guardian Cybersecurity Engine](https://github.com/BruinGrowly/Guardian-Cybersecurity-Engine)
AI-powered security using semantic understanding for intelligent threat detection.
